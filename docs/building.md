Supported Versions: Choose your operating system
---

# Developer Instructions
Steps to build Game Pencil Engine from scratch for each operating system.
Game Pencil Engine is platform dependent and as such there are different guides per operating system:

* [Game Pencil for Windows](building-windows)

* [Game Pencil for Linux](building-linux)

* [Game Pencil for Mac](building-mac)

* [Game Pencil for BSD](building-bsd)

Don't see your operating system listed here? Please check if one of the following libraries work on your operating system:
* SDL 2.0.18 or higher
* SDL 1
* Raylib by raysan

If not, can you recall any recent games or applications ported to your operating system, parhaps there is another module we need to add...
